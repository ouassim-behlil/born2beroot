# Virtualization

## What is virtualization:

- Virtualization is technology that enables the creation of virtual envirements from single pyhisical machine, allowing for more efficient use of resources by distributing them  across computing enviroments.[^1]

- Using software, virtualization creates an abstraction layer over computer hardware, dividing a single system's components such as processors, memory, network and storage into multiple **virtual machines (VMs)**. Each VM runs its own **operating system (OS)** and behaves like separate physical computer, despite the same underlying hardware.[^1]

- The software layer that does this abstraction is usually called **hypervisor*. the hypervisor allocates and manages the physical server.
